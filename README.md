# shopify_debut_translation
Shopify default theme is called 'debut' it is translated to some languages but for the rest of us I am creating this site so people can find / enhance them (at least until shopify provides a better solution)
The structure I am following is the same you can find in the theme archives (localename.json)
Current translations:
  * Catalan: initial translation was created by connexio.cat and lacasadelaswebs.com and completed by me (aseques)
